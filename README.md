# Artic_Hackathon

Code created by me during the Artic Hackathon 2023 for the software FlashEye.

## Execution

1. Download from the FlashEye software the boxes yaml and place it next to the Python script as `input_boxes.yaml`
3. Execute the Python script
```bash
python circuit_script.py
```
4. Using FlashEye's interface, upload the new file `output_boxes.yaml` to the scene
